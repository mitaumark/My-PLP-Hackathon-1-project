                <p>
                    I am a final year Medical Laboratory Science student with a passion for technology. <br>
                    I have hands-on experience in advanced medical diagnostic laboratories, and I am skilled <br>
                    in performing a wide range of laboratory procedures in hematology, microbiology, histopathology, <br>
                    and clinical chemistry. I am also a dedicated, curious, and enthusiastic tech guy, with expertise <br>
                    in graphics and designing, and intermediate web development skills. <br>
                    Currently, I am a student in Power Learn Project Africa at the foundational level, where I am <br>
                    learning more about technology and its applications in various fields. <br>
                    My goal is to combine my medical knowledge with my tech skills to make a positive impact in the <br>
                    healthcare industry.
                    I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and I am always eager to <br>
                     learn new skills and take on new challenges.
                    I believe that the intersection of medicine and technology holds great potential <br>
                    for improving patient care and outcomes, and I am excited to be a part of this evolving field.
